Hi! My name's Nick and I build practical ML infrastructure and the apps around it. I currently work at Zipline, helping bring autonomous drone delivery en masse.

Previoulsy, at [RapidFire AI](https://rapidfire.ai) I’ve shipped a full-stack experiment platform with open-source MLflow to speed up the model selection loop and a distributed task system for hundreds of training jobs. For more of my RapidFire work, check out my other GitHub: [@nick-rfai](https://github.com/nick-rfai). Previous roles at Project Quench (healthcare RAG), Samsara, and Expensify. 

In my spare time, I also work on [Bookshelf](https://getbookshelf.com) for book tracking and sharing.
